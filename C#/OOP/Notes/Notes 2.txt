Object-Oriented Programming with C# - Notes 2

- I've now started creating the Language.cs file.
	- This file contains all the properties for all the text present in the game.
- Created a public abstract class.
- Preciously, we used the get; set; keywords to automatically create a getter and setter for our property.
- However, sometimes we don't want other classes to be able to access or set values of these properties.
- In that case, that's when scoping comes into play.
- We won't use Public or Private, but instead, a different keyword.
- We will use Protected for our setter and set it to an empty string:
	- public string Welcome { get; protected set; } = "";
