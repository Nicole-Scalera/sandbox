# Info
This directory contains a series of files I used to complete a LinkedIn Learning course. Most are code files, but there are some .txt files for relevant notes.

The naming of each folder simply relates to the section of the course I was in. More specifically, I copied the template files from the author's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/practice-it-java-3086189) so that I could follow along, but deleted the completed ones.

Not all files have been copied. See the [repository](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/practice-it-java-3086189) for the full list.
