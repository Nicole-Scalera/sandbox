Notes about Control Flow discussed in this lesson.

- There are three types of control flows discussed here:
    - If/Else Statements
    - Regular For-loop
    - Enhanced For-loop

A. If/Else Statements
- For this part, she used the following example that is very straight forward:

    if (age < 13) {
        price = 5;
    } else {
        price = 10;
    }

- This is good in a situation like determining movie ticket prices.
- Then there is the Else-if statements, to build on to the two possible conditions

    if (age < 13) {
        price = 5;
    } else if (age > 65) {
        price = 7;
    } else {
        price = 10;
    }

- This added in an extra possibility for moviegoers who are above the age of 65.

B. For Loops
- A regular for loop is set up into three separate parts:
    1. The initialization
    2. Boolean condition
    3. The step
- These parts are all separated by semicolons.

    for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        System.out.println(i);
    }

- The initialization says that a local variable called "i" should be created,
and its value should be set to 1.
    - This "i" variable can be used simply as a counter to keep track of the
    number of iterations.
- The boolean condition specifies when the for-loop should quit.
    - i.e., how many iterations should be performed?
- The final piece is the step, specifying what should happen to the variable "i"
between each iteration.
    - In this case, "i++" is an abbreviation for saying "i + 1" ("i" being
    the current value).

C. Enhanced For Loop
- Let's say we have a collection of animals and we want to print out each item
in the collection.
- This type of for-loop is similar, but instead, we only have two parts inside
of the parenthesis.
    1. Handle for the collection
    2. Name of the collection

    for(String animal : animals){
        System.out.println(animal);
    }

- The first part is the handle for the collection, "animal".
- This is saying "for each string called 'animal' in the 'animals' collection,
print out that animal's name."
